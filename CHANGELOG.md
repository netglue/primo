## 0.2.0 - 2020-06-10

### Added

- [#2](https://github.com/netglue/primo/pull/2) Adds `Primo\Http\PrismicHttpClient` interface. This interface is just aliased to the PSR Http Client interface but the Api client factory targets the new interface in the container so that it is easier to change the client used specifically for the Prismic API. Typically, you'd want to wrap the standard client in a caching clientâ€¦
