# Primo…

A silly contraction on [Prismic](https://prismic.io) and [Mezzio](https://docs.mezzio.dev)!

This library integrates the Prismic.io headless content management system with Mezzio.

If you're building websites in PHP and want a CMS without the hassle of managing databases, then this is worth considering as a solid alternative to the usual suspects.

For more information, it's worth checking out the "[Primo Skeleton](https://github.com/netglue/primo-skeleton)" app on GitHub.

Also, this lib consumes [netglue/prismic-client](https://github.com/netglue/prismic-client) which is what you'll be interacting with most when it comes to actually making some content…

## Stability

This library is mainly targeted at not re-inventing the wheel every time you want to build a CMS website using a Prismic content backend. As it's used in a number of production projects, I'm pretty careful with the releases.
